Note: I noticed Jims install script was very basic. It installed ROS-Base, rather than "Desktop_Install" which is what typically goes on the robot and includes libraries I'm rather certain we'll need. Given the limited space available I let it as is for now. (TX2 has more than tx1, so might not be an issue)

"Desktop-full-Install" usually goes on the host machine. 


What I did:
Updated apt repositories with:
sudo apt-add-repository universe
sudo apt-add-repository multiverse
sudo apt-get update

Changed hostname in /etc/hostname and /etc/hosts AionR1 to

sudo apt-get install bash-completion command-not-found htop nano

sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-navigation ros-kinetic-xacro ros-kinetic-robot-state-publisher ros-kinetic-joint-state-controller ros-kinetic-diff-drive-controller ros-kinetic-robot-localization ros-kinetic-twist-mux ros-kinetic-interactive-marker-twist-server ros-kinetic-opencv-apps ros-kinetic-gazebo-ros ros-kinetic-gmapping ros-kinetic-joy ros-kinetic-diagnostic-aggregator ros-kinetic-teleop-twist-joy ros-kinetic-image-transport ros-kinetic-joint-trajectory-controller ros-kinetic-joint-limits-interface ros-kinetic-controller-manager ros-kinetic-razor-imu-9dof ros-kinetic-imu-transformer  ros-kinetic-serial

sudo apt-get install libpcl1

sudo apt-get install libopencv-videostab2.4v5

sudo apt-get install joystick

sudo apt-get install libncurses-dev

Created Catkin workspace using jetsonhacks scripts

Downloaded source codes into the catkin workspace


Install ZED Drivers, Zed SDK

Ran into an error when trying to install the ZED SDK
Checking CUDA version...
ERROR : the installer failed to detect the CUDA version (CUDA 9.0 required), make sure it's installed
The ZED SDK will NOT work without CUDA, Continue  (Y/N) ? 

And cant test roboclaw, as it doesnt seem to be connected.
